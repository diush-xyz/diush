diush is an open-source mobile platform that acts as a funnel to securely and easily finalize sales for items that would have otherwise undergone a tedious, disorganized process via text/DM. It is not a marketplace, simply a platform that utilizes a link-sharing system for each product/item one is selling - it takes advantage of existing communication methods to establish "first-contact".
